{"name":"subsatoshi","tagline":"small things can make a big difference","body":"### Introducing subsatoshi.\r\nSubsatoshi aims to be the reference open-source implementation of the [Value Distribution Protocol](https://github.com/ktorn/vdp). In a nutshell, it enables the distribution of value across a large number of related stakeholders, powered by very small off-chain cryptocurrency transactions, known as microtransactions.\r\n\r\n### How Small is Small?\r\nVery small. We estimate that for our main [use case](#) we will need a granularity of at least 0.0000000000000001 (that's 16 decimals, which is double of what Bitcoin currently supports).\r\n\r\n### What cryptocurrencies are supported?\r\nAt first we will focus on Bitcoin, but our goal is to support as many altcoins as possible.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFilipe (@ktorn), MarcoL (@marcoleong), Gerald (@gestadieu)\r\n\r\nThanks to MarcoS from [Creativen](http://creativen.net/) for the ongoing work on the logo.\r\n\r\nThanks to Serina (@serina-hku) and Gene for joining our team at the [Hackcoin hackathon](https://www.bitcoinhk.org/2015-hackcoin-results/).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nOpen an [issue](https://github.com/macausource/subsatoshi/issues) on our [github repo](https://github.com/macausource/subsatoshi).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
